# Test Plan

## Objective of the Test Plan

The primary objective of the test plan is to verify that the functionalities of the SUT API (React Application) for managing Login, Order, and Product operate optimally and meet user requirements. This includes login, creation, update, deletion, and verification of Orders and Products, providing the user with an effective tool for making purchases efficiently.

This will ensure the quality and reliability of the main system functionalities, improving the end-user experience. These tests will help identify and mitigate defects that could impact user experience and business processes.

### Specific Behaviors to Validate for Login:

* *Correct Authentication:* Verify that valid credentials allow the user to access the system seamlessly.
* *Handling Incorrect Credentials:* Ensure the system provides clear and precise error messages when invalid credentials are entered.

### Specific Behaviors to Validate for Product:

* *Product Creation:* Products must be created correctly and stored in the system.
* *Product Retrieval:* Created products must be displayed in a list accessible to the user.
* *Product Update:* Products must allow easy and efficient modification of their information.
* *Product Deletion:* Products must be deleted correctly and should no longer appear in the system after deletion.

### Specific Behaviors to Validate for Order:

Although the technical test does not reference a CRUD, it is implemented in the API documentation. Therefore, it is essential to develop a set of tests as follows:

* *Order Creation:* Orders must be created correctly and stored in the system.
* *Order Retrieval:* Created orders must be displayed in a list accessible to the user.
* *Order Update:* Orders must allow easy and efficient modification of their information.
* *Order Deletion:* Orders must be deleted correctly and should no longer appear in the system after deletion.

These behaviors are fundamental to ensuring a consistent user experience aligned with functional expectations when using the API.

### TARGET:

Ensure the correct validation of the basic functionalities related to the management of Login, Product, and Order, utilizing test automation through APIs using Postman.

### ASSUMPTIONS:

* It is assumed that the test environment has constant and reliable internet access to make requests to the SUT API.
* It is assumed that the user already has active and valid authentication (such as access tokens) required to interact with the API.
* It is assumed that the names, parameters, and values used in the tests (such as Product names or IDs) are correct and meet the API requirements.
* It is assumed that the SUT server is operational, and the API responds according to official documentation, without crashes or unexpected behavior.
* It is assumed that the API always returns appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, etc.).
* It is assumed that no changes are expected in the structure of endpoints, parameters, or response formats of the API during the test period.
* It is assumed that the API documentation is accurate and reflects the current behavior of the API, including endpoints and expected responses.

### ASSUMPTIONS:

*Login*

* It is assumed that the username and password fields only accept alphabetic characters (a-z, A-Z) and do not allow numeric or special characters.
* It is assumed that the username and password fields only accept 8 characters.

### SCOPE:

The QA team will carry out a comprehensive validation of the correct functioning of the functionalities related to Login, Product, and Order in the SUT.

    * Validate that products are created correctly and adequately stored in the system.
* *Product Retrieval:*
    * Validate that created products are displayed in a list accessible to the user.
* *Product Update:*
    * Validate that products allow modification of their information, ensuring that changes are correctly reflected in the system and accessible to the user.
* *Product Deletion:*
    * Validate that products can be deleted correctly from the system, ensuring they are removed from the product list and cannot be accessed or interacted with after deletion.

*Key Validations for Orders:*

* *Order Creation:*
    * Validate that orders are created correctly and adequately stored in the system.
* *Order Retrieval:*
    * Validate that created orders are displayed in a list accessible to the user.
* *Order Update:*
    * Validate that orders allow modification of their information, ensuring that changes are...

### Technical Validations via API:

QA will perform exhaustive tests using API methods to ensure compliance with the defined acceptance criteria. The tests will include:

*Login:*

* Verify that the user logs in successfully.

*POST (Creation):*

* Verify that Products are created correctly with a provided id, name, and price.
* Verify that Orders are created correctly with a provided id, product Name, quantity, and status.
* Validate that API responses return a status code of 200 and a body containing the data of the created Product and Order.

*PUT (Update):*

* Ensure that Products and Orders can be updated correctly (parameters such as id, name, price).
* Validate that API responses return a status code of 200 and a body reflecting the changes made.

*DELETE (Deletion):*

* Ensure that Products and Orders are deleted correctly upon performing a DELETE request.
* Verify that API responses return a status code of 200 and an empty body.

*GET (Query):*

* Validate that created Products and updated Orders can be queried, and the response returns a status code of 200 with accurate data.
* Validate that the created or updated information is correct.

## 6. RISKS:

| Risk                                       | Mitigation                                                                 |
| :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unable to save the SUT API token            | Send the token via email. Generate the token using cookies.              |
| Lack of knowledge about the API documentation | Ensure the UI is linked to all the requests available in the API.         |

## RESOURCES/ITEMS:

Key resources and elements for API testing:

* 1 Folder = 1 Acceptance Criterion (AC) = 1 Test Set (For 4 acceptance criteria, there will be 4 folders).

*Definition of Test Cases:*

* 1 Folder = 1 Test Case
* Each test case contains the required requests and action steps.

*Mapping Between Elements:*

* 1 Request = 1 Action Step
* 1 Test = 1 Expected Outcome

## ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION:

## Test Report:

During the evaluation process of the System Under Test (SUT) provided, it was identified that the system development is not fully completed. Therefore, tests will only be performed on the functionalities that are finished, while the incomplete sections cannot be tested due to their current state of development.

An initial review was conducted to determine the scope of the tests, confirming that certain functionalities are operational and ready for validation, while others still require development and/or integration. For this reason, the applied tests will be limited to the functional scope of the completed sections of the SUT.

The following approach was implemented:

*Validation of Completed Functionalities:*

* Exhaustive testing was carried out in the areas of the system that meet the necessary criteria for functional testing.
* Compliance with requirements in the completed functionalities was verified, following the standards established in the test plan.

*Limitations in Pending Functionalities:*

* Incomplete functionalities were not tested due to the lack of their final implementation.

*Incomplete functionalities:*

*ReactJS (Product Listing & Order Processing):*

* Verify product listing display and filtering.
* Test order creation, update, and cancellation workflows.
* Check UI responsiveness andÂ accessibility.
